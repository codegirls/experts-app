We're writing an app, this is the public repository we're working on.

## Quickstart

In a terminal, switch to the project directory (i.e. where you
downloaded the repository to, or unpacked the zipfile) and run the
following command:

```
meteor
```

After a while it will display "=> App running at: http://localhost:3000/"
and you can visit <http://localhost:3000> in your browser to see the
app running.

Now you can edit the files of the app, and improve it!

Have fun!
